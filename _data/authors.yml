    In currently a Senior Solutions Architect in End User Computing working at Nutanix, Geek and Ultra Marathon runner. 
    
    I enjoy all things End User Computing with a splash of networking thrown in the mix to make things a little more complicated! I also love to run long distance ultra marathons and visit the pain cave as often as I can!
